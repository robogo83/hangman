# Hangman

## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The game has two main functions:
- check_guess: this funciton checks for a valid user guess 
- ask_for_input: this function repeateadly ask the user for a letter and calls the check_guess function

## Installation
The code is written in Python. To clone the game to your local computer it is recommended to use git clone https://github.com/robogo83/hangman.git

## How to Play the Game
The user has 5 live to guess the word. The user is prompted to enter a single character. The user keeps guessing until all letters are correctly guessed or the user runs out of the lives.
The user has to run the milestone_5.py file in order to play the game. The word_list can be updated or enhanced for more options. Alternatively, future work could call the API to call a random word in order to improve the UX.

## File structure
In the hangman folder there are 4 folders created by me and following the bootcamp instructions. Some functionalities of the code have been improved by me for better UX.

## Licence information
This game is a project for a python skills bootcamp and therefore it is free to use.
